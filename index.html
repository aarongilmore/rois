<h1>Rois</h1>
<p>RÓIS is an Irish composer, multi-instrumentalist and performer whose songs explore diverse modes of expression; forging an idiosyncratic blend of folk and sean-nós, electronics, jazz harmony and extended vocal techniques.</p>
<p>Often compared to the likes of Meredith Monk, Björk or Hatis Noit, Róis is continually adapting her set list which people have described as transcendent and unearthly.</p>
